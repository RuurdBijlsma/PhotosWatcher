# Media Transcoding, Metadata, and Classification

Watches a given folder and generates the following for each new photo/video:

Photo:

* Labels generated by Inception ResNet V2 trained on ImageNet
* Thumbnail 500p & 1440p in .webp format
* Metadata
    * Exif data
    * GPS information
    * Reverse geocoded GPS information (City, province, country)

Video:

* Metadata
    * Video/audio stream codec information
    * Format info
    * GPS information
    * Reverse geocoded GPS information (City, province, country)
* 1080p .webm version of the video optimized for streaming
* Thumbnail 500p & 1080p in .webp format

## What's this used for

I'll be using this code in my private server to create a personal Google Photos clone

## Usage

1. `npm i`
2. Configure `config.js`
3. `npm start`

This will install the dependencies and make the program start watching the given folder for changes, newly added photos will be processed as described above.

## Todo

* Database integration (add entry with metadata when adding media item)
* Better handling of burst / portrait photos
* (Repeatedly) check for any files in media folder that haven't been processed yet
